## Overview

Many of the existing Sc2 build order sites are not updated frequently enough and don't have high enough standards of builds. This site will show the most recent and highly liked builds by the community.


## How to test locally

You can clone this
```
git clone https://github.com/trinric/Sc2Builds.git
```
Make sure you have the latest version of meteor installed.
```
cd Sc2Builds
meteor
```
